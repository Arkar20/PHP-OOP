//* dependency inversion not dependency injection
//! high level code doe not need to depend on low level code. 

//* high level = does not concern about the detail
//* low level = concerns more about the details 

//! the class should not be force to depand upon the another class instead depand upon abstraction or interfaces
//! 1 high level class depand on the interface
//! 2 low level class too
